My plan is to build a chatbot. A lot of the work for this will be setting up the tools for the back end. At this stage it seems like the best way to do this is to have the bot live on Facebook, but if I can I'd like to build a nice-looking front end to interact with the bot from a standalone website. My original idea was pretty ambitious, and was intended to help combat rape culture by chatting with users about what constituted appropriate behavior and what behaviors would be harassy, rapey, creepy, etc. The value of something like this comes from the fact that a lot of men probably don't want to contribute to a culture that is unsafe for women, but are afraid of being [verbally] attacked or demonized for asking questions. Taking out the human element would free users up to ask whatever's on their mind.

However, that's a complex issue and setting up the logic for it would probably take a long time even if I already had a thorough idea of what to include, which I don't without talking to a lot of people more knowledgeable about women's issues than I am.

So in the meantime my plan is to get experience with chatbots by having my chatbot give cocktail suggestions.
