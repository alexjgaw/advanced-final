# fund that

This is the repo for fund that (working title), a platform that manages automatic donations triggered by tweets from Donald Trump and his associates based on keywords.

It's very much a work in progress, and since there's only one person on the dev team it'll probably stay that way for some time.

There's no live version to view yet since I'm still working on the front end, but feel free to clone this repo to take a peek. You'll need MongoDB and Node. I'll post better instructions when the project is more mature.

# Screenshots

Until the project has progressed enough to warrant deployment, here are some screenshots for your viewing pleasure. Note that the project name in the screenshots is outdated.
